	/* This problem set is composed of two exercises, each exercise focusing on a different regression discontinuity design (RDD). In Exercise 1, we follow a standard RDD application, Meyers- son (2014), 
	to study the effect that Islamic political representation had on the educational attainment of women in Turkey during the late 1990s. In Exercise 2, we turn to a spatial RDD, Gonzalez (2021), 
	to study the effect of cell phone coverage on electoral frauds. */
	
/*								Commands									*/

	/* Regression discontinuity designs are implementable with packages such as rdrobust, rddensity and lpdensity, among others, in both R and Stata. You should install these before proceeding. */
	
/*								Instructions								*/

	/* (1) rdrobust reports estimates from different estimation methods: (1) Conventional, (2) Bias-corrected, and (3) Robust. In this problem set, any rdrobust output should be reported with Conventional 
	betas and standard errors. Nonetheless, note that in your own research it is recommended that you report Conventional betas and Robust standard errors */
	
	/* (2) Unless asked otherwise, use as default options for your rdrobust estimates:
		
		-> kernel(triangular) p(1) bwselect(mserd)
		
		*/
	
	/* (3) Have in mind that some commands have different default procedures in Stata and R. Since we are not asking you to specify some of these procedures, it is normal that sometimes the results are
	not exaclty the same between the two languages. */

The estimated Treatment Effect at the cutoff is 3.2019 percentage points for the uniform kernel and 3.0195 percentage points for the triangular kernel. Both estimates are significant at the 5% level using conventional standard errors (as requested in the guidelines of the problem set). It is worth mentioning that using robust standard errors the p-value for the triangular kernel increases to 0.076, hence granting significance only at the 10% level. 
 The uniform kernel gives equal weights to the observations in the bandwith, while the triangular one gives linearly less weight as observations get further from the cutoff. The results are yet fairly comparable between different approaches.  */

/* A: The global unweighted regression yields a point estimate of 3.683 (statistically significant at the 5% level). This is quite different from the one found in point h). If we adopt triangular weights in the regression, the estimates returns a value of 3.028359 (statistically significant at the 5% level), comparable to the one in h) but probably still a bit noisy due to the large number of observations far from the cutoff used and the high-order polynomial that might be overfitting. An alternative strategy is then restricting the sample to a bandwith close to the cutoff and using linear first order polynomials. 

Using the uweighted local regression, the estimated treatment effect at the cutoff is 3.06. Results are not the same in h) yet are not dramatically different. The slight disrepancy might be due to the different weights given to the observations. The triangular kernel used in h) gives less weight to observation far from the cutoff. These are equally weighted in the regression, hence capturing some noise the kernel was cancelling out. Indeed if we estimate the regression in j) using triangular kernels the estimated treatment effect at the cutoff is virtually identical to h). */

	/* (iii) What can we say about the robustness of our results with respect to bandwidth choice? */
	
		/* A: Relying on various intervals for the bandwith shows the bias-variance trade off in the estimation of the local average treatment effect. 
The graph shows the point estimates coming from the adoption of different bandwiths and the 95% level confidence intervals. If we keep a very small bandwith by taking 0.5*opt_i the estimates is likely to be less biased but it is highly volatile. Indeed, the coefficient is not statistically significant, with wide standard errors. The variance diminishes as we increase the width of the bandwith reaching statistical significance when using the values of opt_i. The coefficient slightly increases (from 1.8 to 3.02) compared to the 0.5*opt_i interval, showing that the cost of smaller variance comes with an estimate that is likely to be marginally biased. Increasing the bandwith does not come with a great increase in variance while yielding point estimates comparable to the baseline case of opt_i */
