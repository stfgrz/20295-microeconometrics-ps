/* (a) Note that one of the variables in the data set is stpop, the state population. In the next exercises, you should follow Wolfers (2006) in weighting both your descriptive output and your analysis by the state population. A short summary of the different weighting procedures in Stata is provided here ([1,2]). Given that divorce rates are an average computed in each state and the variable stpop provides the population in each of these states, which is the weight you should use when reporting the evolution of divorce rates or a regression of divorce rates on unilateral divorce laws to match the analysis in Wolfers (2006)? */

	/* A: 	Wolfers (2006) adopts a weighted least squared framework, using population weights for both descriptive analysis and computation of regression estimates. 
	As the treatment variable, the number of divorces every 1000 people, is at the state level and div_rate is a state mean, we should follow  Dupraz (2013) and adopt the state population (stpop) as the analytical weights and robust standard errors with vce(robust). 
	This procedure improves computational efficiency and would yield the same estimates as relying on "fweight" after correcting for proper standard errors. */
	
/* (b) The article relies on the timing of the introduction of unilateral divorce laws to compare divorce rates in the two possible regimes. One of the assumptions of this analysis is that states with the previous divorce law and the ones that introduced unilateral divorce laws would both follow parallel trends in their divorce rates in the absence of the changes to the legislation. Create 2 different graphs to support this assumption: (i) the first graph should convey the same message as the one in Figure 1 of the original paper, comparing states that did not change their divorce laws during 1968 - 1988 (Friedberg's sample) and the ones that did; (ii) the second graph should perform the same description, but focusing on the simpler analysis we will perform in the next exercise: compare the states adopting the unilateral divorce law between 1969 and 1973 to the ones that introduced it in the year 2000, only reporting the time trend up to 1978 and including a vertical line between 1968 and 1969 (when the first reforms in our sample started).

	/* A: A preliminary analysis does not find a strong support for the parallel trend assumption (PTA). 

Graph 2 shows that treated countries had higher baseline divorce rates compared to the control group. From a first graphical exploration control states and reform states seem to follow similar trajectories before the treatment. Yet the difference among the two groups increases over time, starting from 1.238 in 1956 and noticeably reaching 1.71 in 1968 (38% increase). While we observe a relevant rise of divorce rates in 1970, the outcome variable slowly congerges to the pre-treatment levels. 

This can be explained in line with Wolfers (2006): there is a sort of endogeneity of treatment status, as treated countries already showed a tendency towards more divorces, and the reforms simply freed up the marriages that could not break up due to bilateral divorce laws. In other words the increase in the difference could be explained as a result of all the people who could not divorce previously to the reform and cumulated as a stock ready to be released. 

Overall, we cannot clearly support the parallel trend assumptions as we do not rely on any formal test. There is an increasing difference among the control and treated states, yet we do not know whether this is statistically relevant.

As a first step, let us perform a 2-period difference-in-difference analysis using "long differences", focusing on the evolution of divorces between 1968 and 1978. Keeping only these 2 years in our sample, you should compare states adopting the unilateral divorce law between 1969 and 1973 to the ones that introduced it in the year 2000. On this restricted sample, you should create: (i) a variable UNILATERAL equal to 1 if a state introduced the unilateral divorce law during this period (as signaled by variable lfdivlaw); (ii) a variable POST equal to 1 if the year is 1978; and (iii) a variable POST UNILATERAL when both POST and UNILATERAL are equal to 1. */

Hence regression i) overestimates the treatment effect as it does not control for group fixed effect. The Pooled estimate simply computes the difference between treated and control group in the time after the treatment has been introduced. 
		After controlling for group fixed effect through the UNILATERAL dummy the estimated treatment effect of IMP_UNILATERAL in regression i) (1.70 and statistically significant at every conventional level) disappears. The estimated coefficient for regression ii) is negative but very close to 0 (-.005) and statistically insignificant.

	/* A: Across all specification the estimated coefficient for IMP_UNILATERAL should yield the average treatment effect of the introduction of unilateral divorce laws on divorce rates, provided the parallel trend assumption is met. Regression i) estimates a model controlling for both time invariant state fixed effects and time variant effects that are common to all states. This is obtained by adding state and time dummies. The estimated coefficient is -0.05 and statistically insignificant. This supports the hypothesis of a null treatment effect that we found also in the previous simple analysis.
	
Yet as we add a state specific linear trend in regression ii) the estimated coefficient for IMP_UNILATERAL increases to 0.477 and becomes statistically significant at every conventional level of significance. After adding quadratic state specific trends in regression iii) the coefficient slightly decreases to 0.334 while remaining statistically significant at every conventional level of significance. The estimates show a comparable behavior to Friedberg (1998), where controlling for state specifice trends found a positive effect of the divorce law, differently from the the null effect found in the baseline specification. Because the coefficients change over time the estimated coefficients seem to suffer from omitted variable bias due to different trends among the subgroups that are correlated with the divorce rate. 

This bias is less prominent after controlling for state specific quadratic time trends. Compared to Friedberg (1998) we rely on a wider dataset. Overall these result seem to provide evidence that it is unlikely that the parallel trend assumption holds. Indeed, the estimated coefficients should be the same in all specifications provided control and treatment follow the same trends, which seems not to be the case.

Let us now check some of the properties of these regressions.

		/* A: Only the first regression consistently estimates the average treatment effect: the estimated coefficient is 0.056 and statistically significant at the 5% level. In all remaining regressions the estimated coefficient for the treatment dummy becomes negative, though statistically insignificant. This can be explained by the way the simulated data have been created. "Y" includes only a fixed efect and a year effect, while following simulated outcomes include a time varying and state specific effect on the outcome that is not accounted by the regression specification we adopted. Indeed, if we control for state specific time effects in the specification (as in the extra section) the estimates for treatment are close to the "true" values of 0.05. Hence, due to the staggered implementation of the treatment the estimated regressions include a downard bias that is increasing depending on the magnitude of the state and year specific effect. This because the treatment effect is "masked" by the state and time specific effect of state 2 in year 3 that might be due either to specific changes in state 2 at year 3 or by heterogeneous treatment effects.   */
	
/* (g) Use the Stata package "twowayfeweights" (or its R version, "TwoWayFEWeights"), based on De Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020), to estimate the weights attached to the regressions you estimated before. Can you explain why the sign of the estimated effect has changed between the regression on Y and the one on Y4? */

	/* A: The code was executed in part f).
	
	De Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020) show that in a fixed effect design with staggered implementation and heterogeneous treatment effects the fixed effect estimator Î²_fe for the treatment effect could be decomposed as the expectation of a weighted sum of the Îg,t terms, namely the average treatment effect in group g and period t coming from all pairwise difference in differences. The issue is that weights can assume negative values, yielding a downward bias and possibly leading to estimated negative treatment effect even if the average treatment effects on the treated are all positive. Negative weights arise as a result of relying on Difference in Differences where in some cases the control group is already treated due to staggered treatment adoption. 

This is the situation that seems to happen in this case, where the treatment adoption is staggered. The twowayfeweights command show that the estimated Î²_fe is a result of a weighted sum where a negative weight is present. De Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020) show that it is more likely to assign negative weights to periods where a large fraction of groups are treated, and to groups treated for many periods, which in our case is period 3 and for state 2, that is the one starting treated from period 2. This was also the component that influenced the bias in the previous regressions. Thus a plausible explanation of the estimated negative coefficient for Î²_fe is that the negative weighted ATE_2,3 overcompensates the positive contributions of the other ATEs, and that the ATE_2,3 increases depending on the effect of the specific changes in state 2 at year 3, thus explaining why estimated coefficients get smaller from regression on Y2 to Y4.

This situation aligns with the example the authors provide in their paper. They showed that under the error decomposition
Îµg,t = Dg,t â Dg,. â D.,t + D.,. ,
(where Îµg,t is the residual error to compute the weights, Dg,t the treatment status dummy, Dg, the average treatment status of the group, D.,t, the average treatment status at that time, and D.,. the average treatment status overall), the weight given to the average treatment effect of Î2,3 is negative. In addition to this, decomposing the fixed effects estimator as Î²_fe = (DID1 + DID2)/2 they show that bias arises from the second difference in differences:
DID2 = E[Î1,3] â (E[Î2,3] â E[Î2,2]).
Greater increases in E[Î2,3] â E[Î2,2] bias downward the Î²_fe, which explains why bigger increases in the effect at year 3 for state 2 leads to higher biases.

	/* Goodman-Bacon (2021) provides a decomposition of the twoway Difference in Differences estimator (TWFEDD) in case of staggered treatment as the weighted average of all possible 2x2 two group two periods DiD estimators. These differ by the adopted control group: as a group might change treatment status over time, every DiD can either have as control group an always treated group, a never treated group, or timing groups, namely groups whose treatment stated at different times is used as other's controls groups.
	The weights given to the 2x2 DiD depend on the timing group sizes and the variance of the treatment dummy in each pair, which tends to be higher in observations in the middle of the panel. With time-invariant treatment effect the estimator returns an average of cross-group treatment effects where weights depend on the variances and are all positive. In case of heterogeneous treatment effect, negative weights are a result of adopting already-treated units as controls, where the treatment effect might change over time but is subtracted in the pairwise DiD. The authors point out that this does not violate the parallel assumption per se but underscore the need for caution when using the TWFEDD estimator. They suggest the adoption of different strategies, namely event studies, stacked
DD or reweighting estimators. 
	The authors show that the probability limit of the TWFEDD Estimator can be decomposed into the variance-weighted average treatment effect on the treated (VWATT), the so called `variance-weighted common trends'(VWCT), and the the weighted sum of the change in treatment effects within each timing group before and after a later treatment time (deltaATT). The VWCT is assumed to be equal to zero, an assumption called pairwise common trends assumption. Thus, when time-varying treatment effects arise, deltaATT is non-null and biases the estimate while yielding negative weights. 

Plotting the Bacon decomposition for our sample we notice that the assigned weights are all positive as every observation is on the right hand side of the y axis. The estimated coefficient for IMP_UNILATERAL is negative and thus is likely due to a slight predominance of negative estimated average treatment effects in pairwise difference in differences. The large majority (.88) of weights is given to never treated units used as control groups, while "timing groups" and "always treated" units are given weights close to 0. Because already-treated units are usually the most likely source of negative weights but here has negligible importance, this seems to rule out issues with negative weighting.

	/* (iv) Interpret the results of all 3 regressions. What can we see in the behaviour of divorce rates through this analysis that was not possible in the single coefficient analysis? */
	
*The event study regressions offers a clearer perspective on the changing effects of unilateral divorce laws compared to the findings and analysis of question (e). 
*In particular, it is clear that right after the reform is implemented, divorce rates experience a positive and statistically significant increase. The first two post-reform years show statistically significant increases, suggesting that the laws had an immediate effect. The interpretation of this phenomenon is clear: when divorce became easier to obtain, all those couples that were under strain, were finally able to divorce. The effects become not statistically different from zero after the third year. This shows a slight short run increase of divorce rates, that is very short lived. 
*Before the legal reform, coefficients were small and statistically insignificant. This is important to note because it points towards the fact that, without the reform, divorce rates in treated and untreated states were similar. In the longer run, it appears like divorce rate decreases after the ninth year after the introduction of the law. This result is not robust to the introduction of the linear and quadratic terms. 
*When introducing state-specific linear trends, the effect appears to remain for longer, with it staying positive until after 5 years from the introduction of the unilateral divorce law. This is in line with the fact that, if states were on different trajectories before the introduction of the law, not including the time trends might bring to wrongly estimating the impact. 
*When including also the quadratic time trends, we see a short lived increase in the divorce rates , that quickly fades at the third year. These results are similar to the ones found in the simple regression without the linear trends.  
*However it is important to note that most coefficients remain statistically insignificant. In fact, only few coefficients of early post-treatment years show robust effects, and these become less precise as we control for linear and quadratic trends. This points towards the fact that there might be a real short-run response, but long-term effects are negligible or too noisy to detect confidently.

/* (k) Wolfers (2006) presents a summary of the debate regarding the influence of the unilateral divorce law in the divorce rates. How do the conclusions of the paper differ from Friedberg (1998)? How does the author rationalize the difference in his findings? */

*Wolfers (2006) differs from Friedberg (1998) in both conclusions and interpretation. While Friedberg finds that unilateral divorce laws account for about one-sixth of the rise in divorce rates since the late 1960s, Wolfers argues that her results may confound preexisting trends with the effects of the policy. Wolfers finds that although divorce rates rise sharply after the adoption of unilateral divorce laws, this increase is not persistent. In fact, about 15 years later, early adopters tend to have lower divorce rates. He rationalizes the difference by highlighting that Friedberg's analysis may not adequately separate dynamic policy effects from underlying state-specific trends.

/* (l) Several different procedures to estimate a staggered Difference-in-Differences analysis have been proposed recently. Let us now perform one of these procedures. You will use command eventstudyinteract in Stata, based on Sun and Abraham (2021) 

Now perform an analogous analysis to the event-study regression in exercise (i) based on the Sun and Abraham (2021) estimation. Once again, report your results in an event-study graph. Are your results consistent with the ones from the original paper? Briefly explain what kind of correction your proposed algorithm is performing.*/

*In Sun and Abraham (2021) the following is discussed: with heterogenous treatment effects, standard event-study coefficients are not able to capture the dynamic treatment effects. So, with the eventstudyinteract command, the estimators are "interaction-weighted": at first, the CATT (Cohort-specific Average Treatment effect on the Treated) is estimated , then the CATT estimates are averaged across cohorts at a given relative period. These estimators are robust to heterogeneous treatment effects. 

*Comparison with the results from the original paper:
*In general, the results found in this exercise are in line with what was found by the original paper, so in both cases what has been found is a short run increase in the divorce rates in the first years after the introduction of the unilateral divorce laws. After a couple of years, the effect becomes insignifcantly different from zero. When adding squared time trends, there is an unusual output. In particular, ten years before the introduction of the law, there is a significantly positive effect, that then is zero for most of the other time periods analyzed, and it becomes significantly negative after the eleventh period after the introduction of the law.
