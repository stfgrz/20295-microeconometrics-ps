/* (a) Note that one of the variables in the data set is stpop, the state population. In the next exercises, you should follow Wolfers (2006) in weighting both your descriptive output and your analysis by the state population. A short summary of the different weighting procedures in Stata is provided here ([1,2]). Given that divorce rates are an average computed in each state and the variable stpop provides the population in each of these states, which is the weight you should use when reporting the evolution of divorce rates or a regression of divorce rates on unilateral divorce laws to match the analysis in Wolfers (2006)? */

	/* A: Wolfers (2006) adopts a weighted least squared framework, using population weights to account for unbalanced microdata and a treatment variable at the state level. As the treatment variable is at the state level and div_rate is a state mean, we should follow  Dupraz (2013) adopting the state population (stpop) as the analytical weights and robust standard errors with vce(robust). This procedure improves computational efficiency and would yield the same estimates as relying on "fweight" and clustered standard errors. */
	
/* (b) The article relies on the timing of the introduction of unilateral divorce laws to compare divorce rates in the two possible regimes. One of the assumptions of this analysis is that states with the previous divorce law and the ones that introduced unilateral divorce laws would both follow parallel trends in their divorce rates in the absence of the changes to the legislation. Create 2 different graphs to support this assumption: (i) the first graph should convey the same message as the one in Figure 1 of the original paper, comparing states that did not change their divorce laws during 1968 - 1988 (Friedberg's sample) and the ones that did; (ii) the second graph should perform the same description, but focusing on the simpler analysis we will perform in the next exercise: compare the states adopting the unilateral divorce law between 1969 and 1973 to the ones that introduced it in the year 2000, only reporting the time trend up to 1978 and including a vertical line between 1968 and 1969 (when the first reforms in our sample started).

	/* A: A preliminary analysis does not find a strong support for the parallel trend assumption (PTA). 

Graph 2 shows that treated countries had higher baseline divorce rates compared to the control group. From a first graphical exploration control states and reform states seem to follow similar trajectories before the treatment. Yet the difference among the two groups increases over time, starting from 1.238 in 1956 and noticeably reaching 1.71 in 1968 (38% increase). While we observe a relevant rise of divorce rates in 1970, the outcome variable slowly congerges to the pre-treatment levels. 

This can be explained in line with Wolfers (2006): there is a sort of endogeneity of treatment status, as treated countries already showed a tendency towards more divorces, and the reforms simply freed up the marriages that could not break up due to bilateral divorce laws. In other words the increase in the difference could be explained as a result of all the people who could not divorce previously to the reform and cumulated as a stock ready to be released. Due to this considerations, no clear support for the PTA is found but proper statistical test should be adopted to have clear conclusions.

As a first step, let us perform a 2-period difference-in-difference analysis using "long differences", focusing on the evolution of divorces between 1968 and 1978. Keeping only these 2 years in our sample, you should compare states adopting the unilateral divorce law between 1969 and 1973 to the ones that introduced it in the year 2000. On this restricted sample, you should create: (i) a variable UNILATERAL equal to 1 if a state introduced the unilateral divorce law during this period (as signaled by variable lfdivlaw); (ii) a variable POST equal to 1 if the year is 1978; and (iii) a variable POST UNILATERAL when both POST and UNILATERAL are equal to 1. */

	/* A: Across all specification the estimated coefficient for IMP_UNILATERAL should yield the average treatment effect of the introduction of unilateral divorce laws on divorce rates, provided the parallel trend assumption is met. (ASSICURARSI SIA COSI' ANCHE NELLA TERZA iii). Regression i) estimates a model controlling for both time invariant state fixed effects and time variant effects that are common to all states. This is obtained by adding state and time dummies. The estimated coefficient is -0.05 and statistically insignificant. This supports the hypothesis of a null treatment effect that we found also in the previous simple analysis.
	
Yet as we add a state specific linear trend in regression ii the estimated coefficient for IMP_UNILATERAL increases to 0.477 and becomes statistically significant at every conventional level of significance. After adding quadratic state specific trends in regression iii the coefficient slightly decreases to 0.334 while remaining statistically significant. The estimates show a comparable behavior to Friedberg (1998), where controlling for state specifice trends found a positive effect of the divorce law, differently from the the null effect found in the baseline specification. Because the coefficients change over time the estimated coefficients seem to suffer from omitted variable bias due to different trends among the subgroups that are correlated with the divorce rate. 

This bias is less prominent after controlling for state specific quadratic time trends. Compared to Friedberg (1998) we can better identify the state trends before the treatment as we rely on a wider dataset. Overall these result seem to provide evidence that it is unlikely that the parallel trend assumption holds. Indeed, the estimated coefficients should be the same in all specifications provided control and treatment follow the same trends, which is not this case.  
	*/
	

/* (f) In our current case study, unilateral divorce laws have been introduced subsequently in different states at different points in time. In such cases, we say that there was a staggered implementation of the treatment. Regressions with a single coefficient, as the ones performed in exercise e), may be biased in this setting. Let us now check some of the properties of these regressions. We will create a simulated data set of 3 periods and 2 states, where one state receives a treatment in the 2nd period and the other state only receives it in the 3rd period.

		/* A: Only the first regression consistently estimates the average treatment effect: the estimated coefficient is 0.056 and statistically significant at the 5% level. In all remaining regressions the estimated coefficient for the treatment dummy becomes negative, though statistically insignificant. This can be explained by the way the simulated data have been created. "Y" includes only a fixed efect and a year effect, while following simulated outcomes include a time varying and state specific effect on the outcome that is not accounted by the regression specification we adopted. Indeed, if we control for state specific time effects in the specification (as in the extra section) the estimates for treatment are close to the "true" values of 0.05. Hence, due to the staggered implementation of the treatment the estimated regressions include a downard bias that is increasing depending on the magnitude of the state and year specific effect. This because the treatment effect is "masked" by the state and time specific effect of state 2 in year 3 that might be due either to specific changes in state 2 at year 3 or by heterogeneous treatment effects.   */
	
/* (g) Use the Stata package "twowayfeweights" (or its R version, "TwoWayFEWeights"), based on De Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020), to estimate the weights attached to the regressions you estimated before. Can you explain why the sign of the estimated effect has changed between the regression on Y and the one on Y4? */

	/* A: The code was executed in part f).
	
	De Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020) show that in a fixed effect design with heterogeneous treatment effects and under the parallel trend assumption the estimated coefficient Î²_fe for the treatment effect could be decomposed as the expectation of a weighted sum of the Îg,t terms, namely the average treatment effect in group g and period t coming frm pairwise difference in differences. The issue is that weights can assume negative values, yiealding a downard bias and possibly leading to estimated negative treatment effect even if the average treatment effects on the treated are all positive. Negative weights arise as a result of relying on Difference in Differences where in some cases the control group is already treated due to staggered treatment adoption. Weights are computed using the residual of a regression of the treatment dummy on fixed and time effect, that is basically obtained through demeaning. Hence, demeaning on control groups that were already treated is more likely to yield negative weights. 

This is the situation that seems to happen in this case, where the treatment adoption is staggered. The twowayfeweights command show that the estimated Î²_fe is a result of a weighted sum where a negative weight is present. De Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020) show that it is more likely to assign negative weights to periods where a large fraction of groups are treated, and to groups treated for many periods, which in our case is period 3 and the group that is treated from time 2 that we will denote by group 2. This was also the component that influenced the bias in the previous regressions. Thus a plausible explanation of the estimated negative coefficient for Î²_fe is that the negative weighted ATE_2, overcompensates the positive contributions of the other ATE, and that the ATE_2,3 increases depending on the effect of the specific changes in state 2 at year 3.

This situation aligns with the example the authors provide in their papers. They showed that under the error decomposition
Îµg,t = Dg,t â Dg,. â D.,t + D.,. ,
(where Îµg,t is the residual error to compute the weights, Dg,t the treatment status dummy, Dg, the average treatment status of the group, D.,t, the average treatment status at that time, and D.,. the average treatment status overall), the weight given to the average treatment effect Î2,3 is negative. In addition to this, considering Î²_fe = (DID1 + DID2)/2 they show that bias arises from the second difference in differences:
DID2 = E[Î1,3] â (E[Î2,3] â E[Î2,2]).
Greater increases in E[Î2,3] â E[Î2,2] bias downward the Î²_fe, which explains why bigger increases in the effect at year 3 for group 2 lead to higher biases.
